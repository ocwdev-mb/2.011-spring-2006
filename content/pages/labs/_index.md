General Information about the MIT Ocean Engineering Teaching Laboratory (OETL) ({{% resource_link 751b6117-5b22-b82c-c6f5-8838d851dc81 "PDF" %}})

Part 1
------

In Labs 1-6, students construct and test a SeaPerch II Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).

*   [SeaPerch](http://web.mit.edu/seagrant/edu/seaperch/BuildingSP/BuildingSP.html): The Sea Grant SeaPerch site contains general information on how to build the smaller unit with links to other helpful information.
*   [SeaPerch II](http://web.mit.edu/seagrant/edu/seaperch/AdvancedROV/AdvancedROV.html): SeaPerch II is a slightly more advanced design than the SeaPerch I. This is the one we will be designing in class; its instructions are modifications to the SeaPerch I.

### Testing at the MIT Boat House (Charles River)
